## Directions

### Preperation

3. Crush, peel, and finely chop garlic and set aside.
4. Drain and wash kidney beans.
5. Thinly chop or dice jalapeños to your liking.  Remove seeds.  If you prefer a bit more spice, leave the inner rind, other wise, remove it.
6. Shred cheddar cheese.

### Chili

1. Heat a large pot on medium on stovetop.
2. When hot, add olive oil and swirl around the pot to coat the bottom.
3. Add diced green and red peppers and let cook down for 3-5 minutes.  This is to cook off some of the extra moisture and allow them to soften up a little. Stir around to make sure nothing sticks.
4. Add diced onion and cook for another 5 minutes.  The peppers and onion should be a softened, but not mushy.  Stir every few minutes.
5. Add garlic and let cook for 2 minutes.  Everything should still be a little crunchy, but not raw.
6. Once everything is to your desired crunch level, move everything to the outside edge of the pot and add the ground beef.
7. Break up the ground beef into smaller clumps and cook until it is browned.
8. Add beef broth, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and kidney beans.
9. Bring heat down to a simmer and allow to cook down.
10. Add all of the spices to taste.  Use smell and taste to determine amounts based on your preferences.  Taste and continue seasoning while the chili cooks down.
11. Chili is done cooking when the beans have softened.  Make sure to stir every once in a while and make sure it doesnt thicken up too much.  If the chili is too thick, add more beef broth or water.  Depending on temperature, this will take between 30-60 minutes.

### Macaroni

1. When chili is nearing completion, bring another large pot with water to boil.
2. Add macaroni noodles and cook.
3. Drain noodles, but save a small amount of pasta water to add to chili.
4. Add a small amount of butter to keep the pasta from getting sticky.
